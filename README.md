This R script performs Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on phenotypic data to explore the underlying structure of traits across a set of genotypes. It begins by loading the necessary libraries and importing a dataset containing adjusted means. The first column of the dataset is excluded to focus on the trait variables, and PCA is conducted using the PCA function from the FactoMineR package, with variables standardized for analysis. The script extracts key outputs such as eigenvalues, trait contributions to the principal components, loadings, correlation coefficients, and eigen vectors, which are subsequently saved as CSV files for further analysis. Visualizations include a scree plot displaying the variance explained by each principal component and a biplot illustrating the relationship between genotypes and traits, both of which are saved as PNG files. The cumulative variance is also plotted to provide insight into the proportion of variance explained by the principal components, enhancing the understanding of the dataset's structure.
